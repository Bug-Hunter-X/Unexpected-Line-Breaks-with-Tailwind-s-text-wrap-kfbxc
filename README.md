# Unexpected Line Breaks with Tailwind's text-wrap

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `text-wrap` utility.  In certain scenarios involving long words or unusual text content, the line break might not respect word boundaries as expected, leading to visually awkward line breaks.  The issue seems to be related to a combination of Tailwind's `text-wrap` and how different browsers handle text wrapping.

## Bug Report

The primary bug is that text wrapping doesn't always behave as expected, particularly with extremely long words.  This results in unexpected line breaks in the middle of a word, disrupting readability.

## Solution

The provided solution offers a couple approaches to mitigate this issue. One way is to use the `overflow-wrap: break-word;` CSS property to explicitly force breaks within words if necessary.  Another option, particularly useful for maintaining consistent text layout, is to employ the `hyphens: auto;` CSS property, allowing for hyphenation to further improve the text wrapping behavior.
