```javascript
// ... some Tailwind CSS classes
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Uncommon Error</h2>
  <p>This is some text with a very long word that might cause a line break issue with Tailwind's text-wrap functionality and the default browser behavior. The line break might occur in an unexpected place, not respecting the word boundaries correctly.</p>
</div>
